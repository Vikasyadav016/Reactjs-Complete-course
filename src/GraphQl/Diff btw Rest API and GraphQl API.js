// To Tackle and overcome the cons of REST api we use graphQl api.

// The issue or cons of REST api

// 1.) Over fetching

// The over fetching is a issue we get while we do a api request and we get over details innstead of only needfull or required details.
// Example suppose we do a REST api call to get user name and email based on given id.
// Rest api we do that it wil return all detaills based of that given id.
// For avaoiding this we can write another api which will get only name and email but that will be no a god approach.
// This issue is called over Fetching.
// For avoiding this issue we use GraphQl api.

// 2.) Under Fetching
